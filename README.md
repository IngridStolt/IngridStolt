- 👋 Hi, I’m @IngridStolt
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and data engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and practicing Python. I have a lot of experience with writing MatLab scripts for analysing 
- experimental data in small sets but would like to ultimately learn to use other programming languages to analyse large data sets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find a job with the option to work remote in Sweden or on-site in Uppsala, Sweden.
